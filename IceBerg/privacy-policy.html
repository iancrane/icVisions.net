                        <li>When collecting Sensitive Data or Personal Data relating to criminal convictions and offences, proportionality is fundamental.

                        <li>Where Processing is to be carried out on behalf of icVisions, LLC, it will select service providers providing sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in such a manner that Processing will meet the requirements of applicable data protection laws and ensure the protection of the rights of the Data Subjects.</li>
                        <li>icVisions, LLC endeavors to take reasonable measures based on Privacy by design and Privacy by default as appropriate to implement necessary safeguards when Processing Personal Data. icVisions, LLC will thus implement technical and organizational measures, at the earliest stages of the design of the Processing operations, in such a way that safeguards privacy and data protection principles right from the start ('Privacy by design'). By default, icVisions, LLC should ensure that Personal Data is Processed with privacy protection (for example only the data necessary should be Processed, short storage period, limited accessibility) so that by default Personal Data is not made accessible to an indefinite number of persons ('Privacy by default').</li>
                        <li>When Personal Data Processing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of Data Subjects, we will carry out a privacy impact assessment or "Personal Data impact assessment" prior to its implementation.</li>
                        <li>No breach is too small for action. We will examine all claims related to any breach to this Privacy Policy or applicable data protection laws, potential or actual, that are brought to our attention or that we become aware of and will take all reasonable measures to limit their impact.</li>

                            <li>If the Data Subject wishes to restrict the Personal Data rather than deleting it, despite the fact that the Processing is unlawful.</li>

                        <li>Disclosure is made on a strictly limited 'need to know' basis where there is clear justification for transferring Personal Data - either because the Data Subject has consented to the transfer or because disclosure is required to perform or reach an agreement, or for a legitimate purpose that does not infringe the Data Subject's fundamental rights, including the right to privacy (e.g. sharing in the context of a merger and acquisition operation). In each case, the Data Subject will be aware that the disclosure is likely to take place. Assurances will also be sought from the recipients that they will only use the Personal Data for legitimate / authorized purposes and keep it secure.</li>

                    <li>icVisions, LLC may also disclose Personal Data to the extent required by law and/or competent authorities.<ol>
                        <li>If a particular disclosure is required to meet a legal obligation (for example to a government agency or police force / security service) or in connection with legal proceedings, generally the Personal Data may be provided as long as the disclosure is limited to that which is legally required and, if permitted by law, the Data Subject has been made aware of the situation (i.e. the Data Subject was told of the possibility of such an event in an Informed Consent or is notified at the time of the request for disclosure).</li>

                        <li>International Personal Data transfer is a very sensitive topic and is taken seriously before transferring any Personal Data from its EEA country of origin to another non-EEA country, whether such transfer is done for technical purposes (e.g. storage, hosting, technical support, maintenance) or the main purposes (e.g. centralization of client's database management).</li>
                        <li>We never carry out international transfers of Personal Data from an EEA country to another non-EEA country without ensuring that appropriate transfer mechanisms as required by applicable data protection laws are in place, to ensure adequate protection of the data when transferred (e.g. adequacy decision, signature of EU Commission Standard Contractual Clauses as appropriate).</li>
